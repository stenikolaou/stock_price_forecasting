# Stock price forecasting 

This is a python ML project for stock price forecasting using **streamlit** and **NeuralProphet**. 

Before applying NeuralProphet, three artificial neural networks models were tested and more specifically:

* LSTM (Long-short term memory)
* MLP (Multilayer perceptron)
* NeuralProphet
