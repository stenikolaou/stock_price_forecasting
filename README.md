# Stock price forecasting 

This is a python ML project for stock price forecasting using *streamlit* and *NeuralProphet*. 

Before choosing to apply NeuralProphet, three artificial neural networks models were tested and more specifically:

* LSTM (Long-short term memory)
* MLP (Multilayer perceptron)
* NeuralProphet

## Model testing

As mentioned above, before applying NeuralProphet, three ANN models were tested. Before applying the model each timeseries used for testing was plotted and decomposed. Moreover, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test was applied to check for stationarity.
